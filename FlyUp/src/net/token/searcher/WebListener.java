  * we suppose the webdata queen has a format
  * that is the same as tokenItem:
  * which database--which table--which id-->determine the url 
  * (It suggest we should have a relationship with the given infor and the url)
  * for next:what content it contains-->determine the content
  * when it is created -->determine the logtime
  * ???? the most difficult thing is to find out the relationship
  * between {dbname, tableName, id} and the {url}
  * End of the Decreption.
